# About

I'm Simon and I have no house, no children, no debt and so no real responsibility. I figured I should make the most of this.
After watching a fair share of programs about people living off grid, and a healthly lockdown to rattle the nerves, I realised there was no reason I couldn't do this myself. It certainly seems appealing!

However, is it really for me? Am I too conditioned by Western comforts to actually embed myself in a back-to-basics lifestyle? Well I decided to take a year out to find out!

The plan is to stay and volunteer with people who have made the leep and see what's it really like first hand.

So far I've done 10 years working very closely with computers and I honesty cannot complain. But I think like many, there is a niggle in the back of my mind that feels unfulfilled. Is the idea I just do this till I retire and then enjoy a healthy pension? Is that when fulfillment comes?
I don't want to wait and find out. I want to see if going back to basics, back to the type of lifestyle we actually did most of our evvolving with, will realign the body and mind into a state that feels more at ease.
