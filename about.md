# About

I'm Simon, I'm 35 and I have no house, no children, no debt and so no real responsibility. I figured I should make the most of this and take a year off work.

My career so far has been 10 years working closely with computers and all in all I cannot complain. However, computers are not exactly a passion of mine. After watching a fair share of programs about people living off grid (and a healthly lockdown to rattle the nerves) I decided last year that a back-to-basics lifestyle was the direction I wanted to take my life. Aside from the appeal sold by the TV shows, there are three main reasons I have for this:

1. I don't believe western culture is a recipe for fulfillment
2. I do believe going back to basics is
3. I beleive we have to anyway to avoid destroying the planet

So, with my year off work, the plan is to stay and volunteer with people who have made the leap and to see what it is really like first hand. I want to find out if this lifestyle is actually for me. Am I too conditioned by western comforts to endure the realities of it? What are the realities of it? And does it actually bring the fullfilment I've convinced myself it should?
