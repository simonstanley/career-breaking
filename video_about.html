<p class="about-text">
In 2014 jack made a subtle transition from choreography through to
videography and editing. With his experience within dance and working
closely with other film makers and directors it was made clear that he
understood how to capture movement and moments like no other. He managed
to convey this almost immediately with his abstract approach and deep
desire to make sure each frame while editing was nothing but perfect.

Jack has intuitively foreseen companies desire to keep elevated above
the competition with a strong online presence. He has  gone onto provide
videos that cater for social media sites such as Instagram that have
uniquely been designed to clearly promote the brand while building the
brands client base.

such a Adidas, Paco Pabanne, Victoria and Albert Museum, Hippodrome
Casino, ClubMob and many more, filming an array of different works and
forever striving to capture majestic moments where the subject and
