    Choreographer: Jack Pointer Mackenzie<br>
    Company: Proximity London
---

With an extremely vague brief Jack had to masterly tune into the direction that
was being thrown his way. His roll as the principle dancer and choreographer
was to tell the story about the companies history and growth throughout the
last 5 years. His training in jazz and contemporary played a huge part in
making this possible with control and intention being paramount.
