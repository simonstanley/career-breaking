Having been brought on as an assistant choreographer after working on the same
job as a dancer demonstrates jacks unavoidable distinct leadership qualities.
The job at hand was a huge task but one that jack grasped with a cool and
relaxed head. Cleaning the 50 dancers required patience and an assertive
presence with eagle like vision to notice any unfitting gestures that would
affect the shot. Working closely with Supple Nam and Kim Gehrig, jack lead by
example and has been a great asset in creating a ground breaking campaign.
