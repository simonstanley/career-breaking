With Jack’s innate ability to pay close attention to the finer details
which is crucial when it comes to commercials, he surpassed expectations
on these three Sport England commercials in every respect. The idea behind
the three commercials was to inspire your everyday working man or woman
to pick up a sport, whatever age, body type but to simply start. Working
with supple in the prep leading up to the shoot days, they prepared clear
and innovative movement that would look fresh in each space. The first
being Boxing mum, which required choreography that enabled her to move
fluidly throughout her home while naturally using the furniture around
her adding humour, adding to the overall impact of the final video. The
second video was the Olympic wheelchair swimmer that was set in a car park
space and observed a wheelchair user imagining that he’s racing in an
Olympic butterfly swimming race. With minor obstacles in the way jack worked
closely with the dancer making the final product as slick as possible while
aking sure his movement quality was consistent throughout the long shoot
day. The final shoot was of the paper boy, a young lad on his paper round
using the papers as tennis rackets and practicing an array of shots going
from door to door. Over all, everyone was extremely proud of the three
commercials and the client was ecstatic.
