Once jack was directly contacted to choreograph this music Video he knew
exactly which dancers he wanted to use. With a strong background
incontemporary dance and surrounded by professional dancers everyday he
used the two that he felt aesthetically fitted the brief but also
artistically could raise the bar and perform his work to its absolute
best. Once jack and the director  had found an understanding in the first
rehearsal the rest of the job played out like a dream and everyone
including the band were overwhelmed with the final product.
