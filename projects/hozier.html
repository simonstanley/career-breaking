Choreographed by Jack Pointer Mackenzie and Jillian Meyers. This idea was only
brought to life because of them. They constructed a prototype of this video a
year before and once shared online, Hozier’s management got in touch with the
offer of using the concept for the music video. Directed by Isaak Ravishankara,
jack and Jillian first set out to explore how couples can intimately move
together at a music gig, with different couples spread out sporadically within
the crowd, how the audience would react to the immersion of music and movement.
This is clearly captured in the final video ‘Work song’ with Hozier’s gravelly
vocals and jack and Jillian’s phenomenal choreography intertwined as one.
