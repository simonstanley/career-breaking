Having been contacted last minute in holding the audition and selecting two
appropriate dancers for this job, Jack had to tune in closely to what producer
Rob Godbold and director Thierry Albert were looking for.  Jack stepped upto
what was required and triumphed in choreographing movement that drew on his
vast pool of styles that had distinct moments of light and shade. On the day of
the shoot due to an unavoidable lack of space and changes in set design, Jack
had to restructure parts of the choreography and in doing this in a cool and
calm manner, all ran smoothly with the client being openly ecstatic by the work
that was being produced.
