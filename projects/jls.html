Jack toured as well as choreographed for the UK based boyband JLS (Jack the
lad swing) from 2008-2013. Before the tours really kicked off Jack was used
for a few shows (X-factor, Alan Carr, Graham Norton) and from this his
distinguishable professionalism, determination and stamina exceeded the
boybands expectations and shortly after Jack was asked to join the band on their
journey. His early experience rehearsing, touring and performing to as many as
85,000 people has provided him with the necessary tools needed to put together
large scale shows with limited time. His Jaw dropping presence on stage and
choreographic input made an impressionable impact on the audience and the band,
clearly being asked back for all of the tours stemming the longevity of the
bands career together.
