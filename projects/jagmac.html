After JAGMAC’s management sought out jack after all his work with JLS,
he was asked to choreograph their UK tour, travelling with the band for
two months over the summer of 2016. JAGMAC consists of six siblings from
Baltimore who are extremely versatile performers. It was Jack’s job to
choreograph each track and then rehearse the band in executing each
number to its fullest, capturing the vibe within each song and making
each piece unique. The feeling within each track varied so using his
vast pool of movement he brought each track to life with constant
refinement and adjustments. While keeping true to his art form Jack
created some fresh innovative movement which everyone was overjoyed
with. Moreover, the choreography is still being performed to this day
and jacks work with the band continues.
