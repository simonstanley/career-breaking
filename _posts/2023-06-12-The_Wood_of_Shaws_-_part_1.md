title: The Wood of Shaws - Part 1
---
My very first impression for the coming six weeks was the "big room". Rosie welcomed me and Rouven in through the back door where book shelves braced the corners of the room, floor to ceiling, filled with an array of hard back books. In front of these sat a pristine cream/white sofa suite, all neatly positioned around a black wood burner. Up on the walls to the left hung magnificent portraits in varying styles, along side trophied antlers beneath an old rifle displayed on two wooden brackets. I couldn't help flinch at the disparity between the "off-grid", hard grind living I'd been preaching this year was all about and the clearly luxurious abode I found myself in.<br>
"What an amazing house" I said, with full sincerity.<br>
"Thank you very much indeed" said Rosie.

Along with this minor concern, my mind was racing through a number of others; what were the other volunteers like? How would Rouven's high octane German-ness go down? (He was technically my guest after all), but most importantly, were Rosie and Mike crazy?<br>
This last question was addressed when Rosie gave us our first instruction.<br>
"If you could come through to the main room and sit at the table, I'll let the dogs in to meet you... But just ignore them, in particular the Collie. He might go for you if you try to stroke him so just sit there and let him sniff you."<br>
To be fair, I had been warned about this, but Rouven, who had previously mentioned in passing he was not particularly relaxed around dogs, sat stiff.<br>
At this point I will mention that the Collie was called Ruben, so you can imagine all the Rouven/Ruben confusion we were destined for.<br>
The canine introduction went well. Mike sat at the table with us and provided pleasant small talk so that the hounds could sniff our bits unhindered. There were three in total, Ruben the Collie, and Sprout and Maddie, the mongrel brother and sister, their exact breed unknown but the colouring of German shepherds.

<br>
Sprout was the biggest of them, also the most docile... and also the most interested in sniffing nuts.

Maddie was the smallest, her temperament a bit sharper, more untamed and independent.

Ruben was an old dog at fourteen, he'd had a troubled start to life, hence the careful introduction, but in my whole time there I never saw the ferrel side to him Rosie had warned me about. He hobbled around us with his weak back legs sniffing away quite politely. My relationship with all three would grow enormously over the coming weeks.

Next were the other volunteers, across from the large wooden dining table where we sat was the kitchen area, there waiting their turn were Justin, an Irishman about my age and stature but with greying hair, and his girlfriend Charly, a Canadian with long brown hair, standing around three quarters Justin's height and wearing a distinct bullring piercing. They had arrived a week earlier. I smiled eagerly at them both, but only had time for brief hellos before Rosie led us to our room upstairs. We swiftly dropped off our bags and commenced a tour of the grounds.

The house itself had been renovated to a high standard, wooden floors, white walls and large windows gave the country home an open and modern feel. The main layout was spread across one floor with Rosie and Mike's bedroom at one end, going through to their lounge, the kitchen/main room, then in into the so called "big room". The volunteer quarters occupied the whole upstairs where we had bedrooms to ourselves and a shared bathroom.

The entire small holding was situation on a slope. Uphill from the house was the courtyard with a barn, wood stack storage and tool shed(s).

Beside this stood the fenced chicken run complete with two coups.

Up from the courtyard was the veg garden containing a sizable greenhouse and a dozen or so plots for the crops.
<img src="/career-breaking/assets/images/greenhouse_outside.jpeg" class="img-responsive">

Beside this lay the large orchard with an array of apple, pear, plum and cherry trees, all on the cusp of blossom. Finally, at the very top were the donkey and sheep stables, with grazing paddocks beyond.

We walked up to these stables where Mike was now busy grooming the donkey. Rosie introduced us.<br>
"This is Raffles" she said.<br>
Mike gave him an affectionate scratch and a squeeze around the head, 
"Are you going to say hello Rafs?".<br>
Raffles stood quite still, presumably waiting for the groom to continue.<br>
She explained that sadly they had lost their other donkey Harry a few months prior and Raffles, the poor fellow, had only just started getting back to normal. He had lost a lifelong friend in Harry and apparently if the grieving process is not handled correctly, donkeys can effectively die of a broken heart. Their clear sorrow for loosing Harry, and the careful nurture of Raffles through the process was my first glimpse into the affection Rosie and Mike had for him, in fact all their animals, but Raffles in particular. As I came to see, he was the beating heart of the whole operation, and watching him stand regally while Mike manouvered about him with the brush, I couldn't help but feel he knew it.

I enquired why they had Raffles (and Harry) in the first place.<br>
"We bought them to help with coppicing, but it hasn't worked out so we keep him as a pet really, and we just love him"<br>
"Isn't that right Rafs" said Mike, giving him another scratch around the ears, to which he 
bucked his head up. I couldn't tell if he was nodding in agreement, or trying to indicate all these breaks in the grooming were simply not acceptable.

Next were the sheep. They had five; Big Lou, Tino, Dooy, Huey and Elizabeth. They trotted straight up to us and began sniffing us like the dogs had. In fact I was struck by their general dog like behaviour, nuzzling in for a scratch and sniffing around for treats.<br>
"They were all hand reared" Rosie explained "hence their friendliness... except Elizabeth" I looked up to see the fifth sheep staring at us nervously from a slight distance.<br>
"Hello Elizabeth" I called, waving. She jolted at the gesture and ran away.<br>
"Do you use the sheep for wool?" I asked, figuring it a silly question.<br>
"Not really" replied Rosie, "we sheared them once but really they're just to keep the grass down so Raffles doesn't eat too much or get a hoof infection, which they can get if the grass is left to grow too long".<br>
"Oh", I said. _Who the hell is this Donkey?_ I thought to myself. I looked over my shoulder to see Raffles staring at me deadpan, his jaw crunching in circles on a treat while Mike was bent over at his side, busy applying cream to his penis.<br>
"I'm the boss" he seemed to answer.

In the other direction downhill from the house, was the bee garden, an area devoted to bee friendly flowers. Surrounding this was the woodland, originally planned for coppicing but as mentioned, no longer actively managed and left for nature. Finally, at the very bottom of the valley, sitting beside the river Devron, was the five acre grass field for growing hay... and guess who all that hay was for.

Dinner was at 6:30pm, we all sat down round the big wooden table and Mike carried over a huge casserole dish filled to the brim with a lentil satay curry, served with rice. After a few days of pasta and porridge, the smell and aesthetic of the thing was enough to bring a tear to my eye, but the taste left me speechless. Well, at first, once a few mouthfuls had gone down I began the onslaught of compliments, which Mike, seated at the head of the table, gracefully received.

Mike was a stout man with a proud posture, somewhere in his 50's (I'd guess). He wore a comfortable shirt, unbuttoned at the top, and was the breed of man to kept a handkerchief handy. He hailed from Cambridgeshire and spoke with the kind of grand queen's English you'd find in high society, saying yup instead of yes, and clearing his throat thoroughly before speaking. But don't let this paint the picture of a serious man. Half of everything he said was nonsense and that frequently included him dictating aloud the thoughts of his animals.<br>
"Maddie says it's been a hot day today and she'd like a brandy", he said once out of the blue.<br>
At first I was just as baffled as you probably are reading it. But then Rosie joined in.<br>
"Sprout says Maddie drank all the brandy last week so she'll just have to do with vodka"<br>
"Maddie says that's fine" Mike replied.

I couldn't tell if this was some strange indirect way of Mike and Rosie agreeing to crack out the vodka that evening. Were they alcoholics? Yes or no, this exchange confirmed the madness. Seeing the confusion, and probably the hint of worry on my face, Rosie turned to provide the explanation.<br>
"Maddie's an alcoholic you see".<br>
I looked down to Maddie asleep by the wood burner.<br>
"She's had too many" Rosie continued.<br>
My cheek muscles tighten into a smile as I tried to work out what to say. At this Rosie burst out laughing.<br>
"You'll get used to it, we do this a lot".

Rosie sat at the opposite end of the table from Mike, she had silver hair cut median short and wore thick rimmed rectangular glasses. Over the weeks we learned her incredible upbringing. Adopted by two adventurous parents, she spent her youth flying from place to place following her father's career as a pilot in the navy. Aside from the UK she had resided in Sweden, the middle east, west Africa and Canada and she had clearly inherited the boundaryless spirit. She was so open with us, so inquisitive and welcoming, any feeling of getting in the way one might feel from taking full time residence in someone's home was evaporated immediately by her generously gifted attention on us as individuals.<br>
At the same time there was no denying a fire beneath the surface which would not suffer fools. This combination was enough to earn my utmost respect, the madness was a cherry on top.

After dinner and conversation we departed to our rooms for the evening.<br>
"What time do we kick off tomorrow?" I asked.<br>
"We start work at 10, but if you could be here at 9:45 we do a briefing for the day, come down anytime before and help yourself to breakfast".<br>
_10!_ I thought to myself. I had been ready to embrace the 5am starts. This was the final straw, the house, the hosts, the food and now the hours, I realised I'd found myself on holiday.

The very first task I was set next day was to split wood. Mike took me up to the wood stack and showed me the axe, what a mighty tool, and a fine start I thought. Here's the quintessential off grid job, and a chance to feel like a man... Of course nothing's quite as emasculating as a swing and a miss, but three in a row really knocks you down a peg. Luckily Mike had left me to it so I avoided giving off a terrible first impression.

Rouven had the less satisfying task of sweeping the drive, and collecting twigs from the lawn (to clear it for the lawnmower). He of course had a cycling holiday to continue with and so just stayed for three days. He continued to entertain us at dinner by injecting conversation with baffling anecdotes about the obvious flaws in the latest firewall technology...<br>
"Zay seem to sink zat leaving zee encrypted file under root permissions vill stop zee hackers... ha ha ha haaa"<br>
It was true mastery of conversation murder.<br>
Day four was departure day for him. His legs and bum had fully recovered and so was fit and ready to embark into the Highlands. A beautiful sunny day saw him off and we exchanged our fond farewells. As he turned the first corner up towards the steep drive, I swear I heard his navigation device beeping frantically as he announced to himself "Incline up ahead! 15 degrees".<br>
Rouven was my German cycling angel. Like any true heavenly messenger, he arrived at the perfect time and showed me great wisdom. With cycle touring he taught me about pace, safety and the power of company, but perhaps more importantly he demonstrated a great life lesson. For all the times I sniggered at his over caution, or rolled my eyes at his detailed monologues on cyber security, he was always being exactly who he was, unashamedly, and that really is what makes people and life, a hell of lot more interesting. Thank you Rouven and safe travels!

Over the following week the jobs came in in a wide variety. The regular tasks were watering, weeding and housework... I must admit I flinched when I found myself cleaning the toilet on day three, however quickly backtracked on this when I realised it was my middle class pride implying I was somehow above it... but the key daily activity was mucking out the stables.<br>
This was a routine that Justin and Charly had taken the reigns on. Now I love animals. My exposure had mainly been with dogs and cats but it was a genuine life interest of mine to get to know a donkey.. well if I'm honest, a horse was the actual ambition, but tomatos tomartos right?<br>
Needless to say, I was keen to be involved in that chore, but ignorant as to what it actually involved. I did however, receive one snippet of insight when overhearing Justin questioning Mike.<br>
"Ur Mike... When we apply da cream to Raffles's... urrr... penis... Are we supposed to rub it all over, or just like, around?"<br>
"Oh, yup, no, just on the skin around it."<br>
"... Ah". He turned and walked back into the garden. "Charly," I heard him call, "we've been doing it wrong."<br>
It made sense to me now why Raffles was so fond of them doing his morning groom, but regardless, eventually I was asked to swop with one of Charly's shifts and find it all out for myself.

Mucking out was essentially three fold; groom Raffles, collect his poo, and make him a fresh bed. However, before any of that could happen, he would need to be brought out of his stable and into the yard. This first step was completely on Raffles's terms. Before we could open his stable door we needed his harness on, but for that we needed him to stick his head out the door and keep it there. He would do this very nicely, like a good Raffles, but then at the last minute, as the straps are just about round the ears decide to jolt back in and duck his head away. You know, just because. On some days this dance could go on for 10/15 minutes. Once on we could open the door and lead him out into the yard, tie him up and begin the grooming... Unless of course we open the door and he just stands there. Now let's be clear, he was definitely a smart donkey and knew exactly what the routine was all about, this was just some sick game he liked to play. I also discovered in this just how heavy a donkey is. All this had to be on his terms because there was no way he could be manhandled. Just leaning against him was enough feel his unmovable weight. So, once Raffles felt good and ready, he'd walk out and wait to be pampered.

The grooming routine was thorough. A full dry brush of his coat to remove dirt and loose hair (and make him look fabulous), followed by a second brush through using the aromatic tea tree oil to deter mites (and make him smell fabulous). Then came the creams, one was for his outer ears, chest, mane and tail to keep them clean, while the second was for his inner ears and infamous penis perimeter. This was another insect repellant but for those sensitive areas. Once good and creamed up, we would lead him into the paddock (again in his own sweet time) where he'd spend the day with the sheep. Without fail, the first thing he'd do after all that careful prep was drop to the floor, roll over on his back and rub himself in the mud. Of course this is all natural, and beneficial behaviour, but it was hard to push away the feeling that it was his version of giving us the middle finger. A middle finger that stood strong as we'd then scurry into his lair and feast our eyes upon the inevitable present left piled up in the center.

For this next step, the aim of the game was to get all the straw, much of which was showered in piss, out and away and leave nothing but the pure premium donkey dung. This brown gold was of course Raffles's real contribution to the system. The quality manure was collected and stored ready for spreading during the next growing season.<br>
An interesting aside to this was my learning the value of keeping lifestock. I am a part time vegan, primarly for environmental reasons and so advocate land use for growing veg being far more effient than using it for rearing animals. This extended to an idealistic view where no animals would be domesticated for farming purposes. But learning about the digestive magic that happenes inside the gut of any livestock, I realised we would be doomed to rely on manmade fertilizers to actually grow all that veg. Like most things, the correct answer is a sensible balance.<br>
The first stage of the plop extraction was done with pitch forks, lifting away the majority of the straw and burrowing it off to be burnt. The next bit required some surgical precision. With the use of disposable rubber gloves, one lucky nominee would manually sift through the pat, picking out the smaller strands of straw smooshed into it.<br>
Justin had acquired a particular taste for this and his technique became legendary. Legs spread, bending at the hips and one hand behind his back, he'd take a deep breath and lean in. The free hand would then skirmish through the heap pulling loose the fouled straw while the rest of his body held back the gags.<br>
One of the strange delights about the deposit was it's temperature. When it looks so much like it should be warm, something about the unexpected coldness added to the discomfort of it all. I actually didn't mind the job too much, but despite offering to take his shift on a number of occasions, Justin was insistent we take turns. A true gentleman.

The final step was making up a fresh bed for Raffles. The instruction given by Rosie on this was to make it comfortable enough that you'd sleep in it. So pitch forks at the ready, we'd finish the morning plumping up layers of fresh straw ready for Mr Raffles to inspect.

On top of the routines were various one off jobs that needed tackling. The river had broken its banks in the previous winter and left debris on the hay field, so the first big task of the stay, before the grass shot up, was to rake this all up, and along with great trunks of driftwood, create a huge bonfire. The raking and collecting stage was the classic labour I'd be craving, while the satisfaction of setting it ablaze was pure caveman porn. The three of us were very proud of our fire...
<img src="/career-breaking/assets/images/bonfire.jpeg" class="img-responsive">

Over the first two weeks I got to know Justin and Charly more. They had first met on a guided tour in Amsterdam, but living either side of the Atlantic meant the relationship was slow to flourish and indeed didn't really kick off until a year later when they met again in Panama. Since then they had roughly split their time between Canada, Ireland, and travelling. One of my interests coming into this was the people I'd meet and in particular their reasons for doing this kind of work. Justin and Charly's reason was essentially to provide cheap travel so they could be together more. There are many types of partnerships and lots of ways that relationships can be built and maintained. It was clear from the start that these two were in the type of relationship I most admire, one that involved a rather healthy helping of laughter. In fact, Charly put it very nicely in one conversation we had.<br>
"Me and Justin would still hang out with each if we weren't together."<br>
They were genuine best friends.

While we admired the bonfire we all felt the missing ingredient... cold, frosty beers. Well I say that, turns out Justin is perhaps the only Irishman that doesn't like beer (including Guinness), but instead opts for the extra sweet and fruity ciders. Regardless, we vowed that evening that we'd get some drinks in and have an evening sesh at the next convenience. Which is exactly what we did, to our peral, but that's a story for next time.

And so, my opening weeks at the Wood of Shaws had gone from strength to strength. The routine of no alarms, sensational food, and extraordinary company had launched me into an excellent start to the year (albeit far more luxurious than expected). But the number one take away that kept a smile on my face was the fact the whole thing was pretty much stress free... certainly an attribute I wanted to carry through for the whole year, and if at all possible, the rest of my life.
