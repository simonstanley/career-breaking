I woke up in London alone. My good friend and gracious host Pinky had left for work leaving me with an empty flat.  The night before we'd made our way to the pub for some farewell drinks but ramped this up with a pub quiz. In a dangerous turn of events, we won. The prize resembled that of a fair ground raffle where by we were granted first choice from a table of booze. I opted for a mighty fine looking Rioja. I had no intention on weighing my luggage down further with it so we headed back to his flat and saw it off into the early hours.

I opened my eyes tentatively next morning, waiting for the inevitable throb to kick in and it's good friend regret. But nothing. In fact I felt pretty good. The hangover Gods had spared me their rath on the best day possible. I offered up my thanks and praise with a pint of "make sure" water and began getting ready.

With my bike loaded up like a pack horse, I made the swift cycle down to Kings Cross station and caught the 10:30 train to Edinburgh. It seems I didn't escape entirely unpunished for the evening's shenanigans as I spent most of the four and a half hour journey asleep. Crossing the Scottish border with forty minutes to arrival, I awoke. There is a special kind of grog one feels after travel sleep. The seated position that leaves the head swinging around under its own weight somehow hinders a restful slumber, and so, wiping sleep from my eyes, I stared out at the passing coastline and tried not to think about the looming thirty mile cycle.

My ultimate destination was a small holding called the Wood of Shaws in north Aberdeenshire (near Banff) where I'd volunteer for six weeks. The circumstances of my stay and the company I'd be keeping were relatively unknown. I'd spoken with Rosie and Mike, my hosts for the stay, back in November and although my impression was good, there is never a guarantee on sanity when comes to online interaction. But there was no turning back now, I was on my way, and I would find out my fate in a matter of days.

In the meantime, the plan was to make the 160ish miles from Edinburgh by bike, wild camping along the way. In Scotland they have the "right to roam", that is, it's legal to wild camp. Whether that applies to cities, suburbs, farmland etc, I don't know but either way, being from the south of England, I would be aghast to feel myself camping somewhere in the way. From my brief glance at satellite imagery, it appeared the type of wild I'd feel comfortable camping in was beyond the reach of Edinburgh in the five hours of daylight I'd have to get there. Therefore, my first stop was a campsite, thirty miles north in Kinross.

After gulping two bananas on the platform, I left Waverly station. The sun was out and the wind was low, both of which helped clear the foggy mind and raise the spirits. Day to day I'm not in the habit of taking photos, but dutifully I reminded myself before ploughing on through the city to take an opening snap.

The journey was marked by notable potholes (I've since discovered Edinburgh is infamous for them), the crossing of the Forth road bridge and the painstakingly learnt wisdom that the top of the hill, is not the top of the hill.
My yet to be named bike handled them all with such sturdiness and grace, I knew this to be the first chapter of a life long love affair.

Three and a half hours later I arrived at the campsite, around 7pm, feeling tired. This indeed was a decent leap from the usual amount of exercise I did. My "normal" life was working as a computer programmer, and so aside from the daily walk to work, my entire body was used to a pretty permanent state of rest.
It being April, the campsite was not busy. As I walked to my pitch, I clocked the two other tents occupying the field. Next to my neighbour's tent stood a bicycle with well packed panniers hanging off just about every inch of the frame. It's owner emerged and clocked me wheeling my own carriage in his direction.
This moment was a point of conflict for me. I'm an introvert and so the default preference I just can't shake is always for solitude, particularly when it comes to people I don't know. It's somewhat of a bug bare of mine as I'm most happy around people and I delved into this year knowing full well, and embracing the fact, I'd be bombarded with meeting new folk. I didn't allow myself to overthink it and threw up a hand with a friendly "Hello". The young man approached and I introduced myself.
"I see you're bike packing as well" I said, "I'm Simon"
"Uur yes, zat is correct. My name iz Rouven" he replied in a thick German accent.
He had long dark hair tied back in a ponytail, stood a few inches smaller than myself and wore perfectly round glasses. He was dressed head to toe in cycling gear, the Spandex stuff that serious cyclists wear, and although all in all slender, had a very neat pot belly protruding out the front.
What this says about me I don't know but I found it a relief to discover he was somewhat awkward. Well, not awkward, rather, not quite so fluent at conversation as your everyday confident person. He would answer all the questions I could throw at him with passion and gusto, but seemed at a loss when it came to igniting a topic of his own. The key discovery however was that we were both heading north. I left it at that, not broaching the prospect of joining forces as this would be a step too far for my social capacity. And regardless, we were planning different routes anyway. We said our good nights and I settled into my nice new tent (for the first time) and enjoyed possibly the best Pot Noddle I've ever had.
 
The route I had planned was through the Cairngorms. For those that don't know, which included me up until a couple of weeks before leaving, the Cairngorms is a mountain range in east Scotland where skiing takes place. I'd planned this route solely on the basis that looking at satellite imagery, it looked wild. If I'm going to cycle through Scotland, I want to see the rugged landscapes it's famous for with free reign to stop and camp wherever I like. When I was informed it would perhaps be tough going, especially for a first timer fresh from the office chair, I sort of flinched. But, following the well received wisdom from a colleague, "You'll be alright. It'll be hard but you'll adapt", a very apt statement for the ethos of the whole year, I held firm to my plans... That was until my first night's "sleep".

The campsite was at no significant altitude, but a clear sky left the temperature to drop over night. I had justified not splashing out on a fancy sleeping bag by bringing thermals (and other layers) with me. Super sleepy after my lovely Pot Noddle, I wrapped myself up and tucked myself in at 9pm.
I must say, I woke up really rather refreshed. The first thing I noticed though was the cold. It seemed for all my layers, the body heat had found a way to leak away from me. I winced open an eye to see it was still dark. No bother I thought, I felt rested and I'm quite happy to head off for a nice early start. I fumbled around for my phone to check the time, 10pm... Oh.
I'd slept a measley one hour and was now very awake, and very cold. Needless to say it was a long night. I concluded somewhere in the early hours that perhaps continuing this up into the snowy peaks of the Cairngorms was a bad idea. There was a clear alternative route round the coast, through Dundee and Aberdeen, that seemed if nothing else, safer, and I knew my parents would be on board. In the back of my mind I clocked that this was the route Rouven had planned.

I'd given my 160ish mile journey a schedule of four days. Any cyclist will tell you, forty miles a day is very leisurely. As the tent warmed up in the morning sunshine I got my best sleep, comforted by the time buffer I'd given myself. There was no rush. I continued the slow pace with the morning duties; cinnamon porridge for breakfast, followed by a green tea and a nice poo. I made my way down to the "camper's bothy", one of those standalone offices you see on building sites, to stick my phone on charge. On my return I clocked Rouven beginning to pack up. We acknowledged each other with another exchange of friendly waves. Carrying on, I washed myself, washed the dishes, and began thinking about packing up my own bits, all at the deliberately slow pace one should expect when on holiday.
By the time I got to packing up the bike, I couldn't help notice Rouven was still working at it himself. It seemed his little one man tent was some distant cousin of the TARDIS. Again and again he would crouch down and disappear into it, then reverse back out, dragging yet another bag brimming with equipment, where was it all coming from? It was clear he knew what he was doing, strategically placing items on the ground ready for loading in a well rehearsed order. We had spoken the evening before about his many prior bike packing trips around Europe, but this was the moment I realised he was a pro.
As I stuffed my bits and bobs into the spaces I could find it became apparent we would be ready at the same time. Again my introvert nature kicked in at the prospect of us cycling in tandem, but it being 11am by now, and unable to simply stop packing and stand around. I let nature take its course. And of course, the stars aligned. We looked across to each other as we both clipped in our helmets in perfect synchronicity.

I knew full well we were taking the same route now, and at the very least there would be an awkward conversation coming. But once again I pushed back against my gravitation towards solitude and leaned into what fate was passing my way.
"Morning Rouven. I've actually decided to take the same route as you now, fancy joining forces?"
"Yes, zat vood be very well"
I hate to admit it but there was a straw that broke the camel's back in me deciding to ask. Phone battery is a precious resource out in the barren wilderness, and my phone was my navigation device.
"Do you have the route mapped out?" I asked,
"Yes, I have synced my Komoot account to zee Garmin and all iz vedy"
I stared blankly for a second wondering whether to ask for some elaboration, but concluded the 'Yes' was enough for me. "Great, I'll follow you" I said, switching my phone to airplane mode and storing it away.

As soon as we set off I knew I'd made the right decision. Rouven set a pace which I now would argue strongly is the correct way to bike pack... Slooooowwww. Left to my own devices, like the previous day, I would push myself to maximum capacity at every turn, driven by the un-shiftable desire to arrive. Life's a journey, not a destination, a classic piece of wisdom I expect most would agree with, but putting it into practice is actually quite hard. The drive to finish something is a big part of the drive to do anything in the first place, right?
I'm not entirely sure Rouven's pace was motivated by this wisdom though, rather, it was simply his pace. His smaller stature, his fully loaded bike, and as I now discovered, his lack of acquaintance with hills, meant he naturally travelled with patience.

I soon discovered he was also a cautious fellow. As I pedaled steadily in his wake, I was the recipient of regular updates from the road ahead.
"Pothole" he would call, the pothole clear as day.
"Car up ahead", he'd shout, the car coming towards us, clear as day.
"Incline up ahead, 5 percent", the slope up ahead, clear as day.
At each passing car he would stop dead on the verge and wave it past. Fair enough for the narrower roads, but when I say you could get a bus through that, I'm not joking.
Every single junction was clearly indicated with an sturdy outstretched arm, long before we reached the junction and regardless of the presence of cars. We were following a designated cycle route (route 1 which runs from Dover to Tain), that took us through barren tracks with no one in sight for miles, but this had no baring on the conviction and structure of that outstretched arm.

The route was relatively flat, the weather was fine, and I can honestly say, with Rouven's guidance I did not break a sweat. Instead I had time and energy to enjoy my surroundings and bask in the new life I'd thrown myself into. We managed our forty miles in good time and arrived in Dundee late afternoon, where we pulled into a Sainsbury's for supplies. 
Another enormous benefit of cycling together was security. With our lives contained on the bikes, having one to keep guard while the other performs necessary duties was invaluable. As I emerged from the supermarket Rouven was stood talking to a gentleman dressed in bright yellow high vis, straddling a bike of his own.
"Hello" I said, introducing myself.
"Just admiring your bikes" he replied in his gentle Scottish accent, "you guys bike packing?"
We explained our circumstances, to which he expressed great envy.
"I've always wanted to do it myself but never had the chance. I'm Simon by the way"
"Ah!" I said, "I'm also Simon!"
Us Simon's are a semi rare breed, I don't meet too many so it's always a pleasant surprise.
He inquired on our sleeping arrangements and Rouven showed him the spot he had in mind on the map. He'd had a look beforehand and spotted a scout centre a few miles north of Dundee which he assumed would have good camping. Again, the legalities of this I don't know but Simon, who was a local, was reassuring in that he made the very valid point, "If anyone's going to be okay with a couple of guys wild camping it's the scouts".
Upon seeing the location he asked if he could join us in our cycle up there.
At this, my stranger danger alarm bells went off. I don't know what it's like in Scotland but where I'm from it's not normal for a bloke to decide on a whim to drop his shopping plans and cycle off with a couple of strangers. This is exactly the situation that'll be the death of me. There was no way in hell my southern politeness would refuse this heartfelt request. Plus, I'm all to aware that the level of reserve in my home county distorts any sign of open friendliness all too quickly as sinister intent. And so, we agreed and he came along.
I'm pleased to say this was a good decision. As we cycled out of the city Simon proved to be a cheery chap with a real love for life... except that is for his very clear distaste for cars. He would cycle in the middle of the road and reluctantly pull over when a car came up behind, followed by a tut as they veered round.
"There's just too many cars on the road" he'd say, "I just want to enjoy my cycle in peace".
This all made me quite uneasy. I'm a live and let live guy, people drive cars, it doesn't make them bad people, but I couldn't help admire the man for his unshakable stance on the destruction cars have caused the planet. The demonstration of his equal right to use the road, while at first putting me on edge, unlocked something in me. For safety and practically I always tucked myself into the curb as much as possible. This is fine, but has led to me feeling a kind of imprisonment I hadn't really noticed. I'm not going to change this, but Simon's approach made me see the road differently. It's free to use, it's shared by all, it's open, and although dangerous, it's a wonderful piece of infrastructure that allows us to glide around the world with significant ease.

We arrived at the scout centre, and kudos to Rouven, found a wonderful grove of trees tucked away, perfect for some sneaky camping.
Simon left us to it with a fond farewell and I hope a little more inspiration to bike pack himself. I'd love one day to see him again on the road, with a tailback of beeping cars in tow, and big smile on his face.

We set off early, 9am, next day after a better night's sleep. The next destination was unknown exactly, but all we had to do was follow the route 1 route and arrive somewhere just shy of Aberdeen. The day passed by nicely. At some point mid morning I realised that traveling like this, by bike, was now my new favourite way to get around. I have no explicit reason why, but it's hard to ignore the perpetually pleasant feeling that comes from gliding around on a well functioning bicycle.
The blissful travelling was occasionally jolted by a pang of nerves as I'd remember the unknown of what was in-store upon arrival. Please don't let them be crazy. 6 weeks is not a long time, but it's long enough to suffer if I found the hosts difficult. I'd take a breath and look at the wonderful scenery to bring myself out from the spiralling hole that we call worry.

The journey up the east coast was through the land of farms. You may assume that to mean a monotonous landscape, but the track took us through woodlands, country roads, quaint towns, and a multitude of fields being actively managed in some way, due the time of year. As well as this I passed three or four of what are now my dream homes. One in particular, perched atop a hill looking down into the bay of Montrose had chickens, vegetable plots, fruit trees and arrays of daffodils lining the garden walls, all coloured in by the Scottish sunshine, painting the ideal country home.

Beyond Montrose we stopped briefly along the way at the Den finella waterfall, just past St Cyrus, and admired the mighty plummet undertaken by the Garvock Burn.

[Waterfall image]

When it came to finding a spot to sleep, the acre's of farmlands did become a hindrance. We'd set our eyes peeled for anywhere that looked suitable but nothing much was showing up. It was around 5pm, so still plenty of daylight left, meaning plonking ourselves down in some open field might feel a bit too obvious. The route took us closer to the coast and I felt an opportunity. Coastal paths and/or beaches tend to be public land, which I assumed was fair game given the right to roam. We found a track that led towards the sea and held our breathes for a camp-able spot. As we reached the fence line, there on the other side, set nicely in from the edge of the cliffs was a purpose built hut for viewing the plethora of seabirds swarming around the coastline. We'd only been camping two nights but already the prospect of an indoor shelter to settle in for the night was like looking upon the Bellagio after a trek through the dessert.

A few folk were still around, viewing the birds nesting in the cliffs, and they did not to bat an eye as we hoisted our gear over the fence and towards the hut. Our intention was clear, and they had nothing for us but an admirable smile. This is the kind of attitude I unfortunately do not assume people to have. Maybe I've grown up around too many people complaining about stuff, but so far here in Scotland, it seems everyone is just, well, nice!

I enjoyed my pasta and peanut butter supper with a can of beer, whilst admiring the busy birds surf the onshore winds with precision and mastery. Following this, my bowels made the call that this was to be the place I take my first wild poo of the trip. And what a poo it was. I found my spot to squat just behind some thistle not 5 meters from the edge. I eased it all out into the purpose dug hole with great pleasure as I gazed down at the beautiful Aberdeenshire cliffs and out to the North Sea.

[Cliffs image]

As planned we set up shop inside the viewing hut, safely sheltered from the winds, and found it to be very comfortable indeed. Once again my night's sleep went up a notch.

We woke up to Easter Sunday. I took a look but no eggs had been left. I felt a little short changed when I stepped outside for the morning wee and saw a bunny hopping off in the opposite direction.
Today was the last full day of cycling. The plan was to arrive at the small holding on the Monday, preferably midday-ish. This meant the same again, continue along route 1 through Aberdeen and onwards north. I failed to mention that route 1 just so happened to pass by my destination within a mile or two. It was too perfect.
Once again Rouven's steady pace set the tempo for the day and we cruised through Aberdeen, stopping for lunch. Beyond this we covered a number miles cruising along a flat cycle track we later confirmed was an old railway track.

The day ended again with the dreaded hunt for a decent spot to camp. Rouven spied a nice line of woodland in a valley and we pushed our bikes in to take a closer look. There was a clearing that looked perfectly suitable, albeit some serious removal of ground fodder required, but it seemed neither of us were in a hurry to unpack and set up. There was an unease in the air. This was a fairly open woodland, slightly tucked away but we were still visible from the road, particularly in the daylight. Again we'd stopped around 5pm and the realisation of having four hours to kill, in a fairly exposed spot seemed to drive our hesitation. I figured this was just all part of it and motioned to except our fate and begin preparing the ground, when Rouven, inspecting his phone closely, spoke up.
"Zair iz a campsite around ten miles north. Vot do you think of vee head zair?"
Music to my ears. Without hesitation I concurred. "Yep, let's do it!".
We jumped back on the bikes and gleefully cycled towards what felt like a guilty pleasure.

The ten miles north was also a welcome bonus as it meant ten miles off tomorrow, and I for one, after a very flat day on the old rail tracks had plenty of energy left.
We pushed on and arrived at Ythan Valley Campsite an hour later.
To call it a campsite is a push. In my opinion it's something beyond that. Liddy, the owner welcomed us in with open arms and a cup of tea. It turns out we were in fact to be pitching up in her (large) back garden. We were her first guests of the season and had the whole place to ourselves. Her grass was luscious and flat, and she choose us a spot sheltered from the prevailing wind. She then pointed us to the wash room, which included free hot showers. I had not had any kind of shower since London and although I'll argue I did not smell, and did not desperately need one, I bloody well had one. It would be like turning down a swim in a tub of jelly beans just because you're not hungry. The whole experience was a real treat and although back in the tent, the sleep-o-dar went up once again.

A nomadic camper's worst hindrance is rain. Keeping everything dry as you stow it away takes ten times longer and packing a wet tent feels somehow sinful. We had been hit by rain twice so far, both times in the night, and both times, the rain had stopped right on que as we roused from our sleeping bags.
For a first timer like myself, it's hard to gauge what useful equipment to bring and you soon realise what you've missed. For me it was a peg to hold back the tent door (a minor floor in the tent design) and a lighter. But these were easily remedied. On the other hand, there is equipment you do bring that you had no idea would be so useful. My top recommendation for any prospecting bike backers is a sponge. I took great pleasure methodically wiping off the droplets of rain that covered my little tent and squeezing out the would be weight onto the grass. It's quite remarkable how much water there actually was.

As we packed the sun broke through and once again the daytime weather was on our side. We loaded up in good time and set off for the final (half) day of cycling.

Rouven by this stage was suffering a little. His previous tours had been around North West Germany and the Netherlands, i.e flat lands. The hills we'd contended with so far were fairly minor by English standards and near on horizontal by Scottish ones. His journey beyond my stop was a circuit west to Inverness, then back down through the Cairngorms. He was well aware from his research what he had in store and my only reassurance for the completion was his patience. Never the less, his knees were beginning to suffer and he asked if it would be possible to rest a day at the small holding. I messaged Rosie with the request and she confirmed straight away with no questions asked. I knew now at least she was kind, the crazy question still stood, but was now less important.

The final turn onto the final road saw us pedalling along one side of a valley. Gently meandering down its centre was the river Devron, cutting through the fields and farmland on its flanking slopes. At last we arrived, signpost reading "The Wood of Shaws", we turned into the long driveway down towards the house and were met with a torrent of barks from the three dogs running along the fence line with us. I spied the gentleman standing in the yard who greeted us with a wave.
"You must be Mike" I called
"Indeed, if you swing your bikes round to the courtyard I'll meet you there".

And so ended the journey from South to North. My life on the road came to an abrupt ending as dismounted my bike and prepared for the first major chapter of this year. There waiting for us at the back door was Rosie, wearing a big smile.
